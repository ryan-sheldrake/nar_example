Example of using the Nexus Maven 2 nar plugin. 

Just run as a normal maven build clean install or deploy to send to a maven 2 hosted repo. 

Note you will need to disable 'Validate that all content uploaded to this repository is of a MIME type appropriate for the repository format' and I made the 'Layout Policy = Permissive" for proof of concept.
